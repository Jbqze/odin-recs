            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then reduce to low (or turn off the heat).</li>
            <li>Crack the egg in a fine mesh sieve (over a small bowl) and remove the liquidy whites.</li>
            <li>Transfer the egg to a small ramekin or bowl.</li>
            <li>Add one tablespoon of light-colored vinegar to the pot and stir to create a vortex.</li>
            <li>Pour the ramekin with the egg into the middle of the vortex and set a timer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the egg is done, use a slotted spoon to remove the poached egg. Dab with a paper towel to remove excess water and eat immediately.</li>
